updated  am et sat august  
cnn  debra stevens was working her normal newspaper delivery route in fort smith arkansas when rising flood waters began to overtake her suv

the final desperate  call of the yearold woman who delivered the southwest times record to front doors came at  on the morning of august  it was a panicked minute plea for help with a dispatcher that the fort smith police department admitted sounded calloused and uncaring at times

i have an emergency  a severe emergency stevens told the female dispatcher i cant get out and im scared to death maam can you please help me

a terrified stevens told the dispatcher over and over that she was going to die in the rapidly rising water she wept and asked repeatedly when help would arrive she didnt know how to swim she said she had trouble describing her location she didnt want to die she said

youre not going to die the dispatcher said in audio released by police this week i dont know why youre freaking out you freaking out is doing nothing but losing your oxygen in there so calm down

stevens said water was pouring into her car it would soon ruin her new phone

do you really care about your brand new phone the dispatcher asked youre over there crying for your life who cares about your phone

stevens said she didnt see the water on the road she came up on it suddenly she kept apologizing the water was starting to reach her chest she said she could see people in the distance looking at her theyre probably laughing she said

maam im sorry stevens cried

stevens at one point said she needed to vomit

well youre in water you can throw up the dispatcher said its not going to matter

crying uncontrollably stevens asked the dispatcher to pray with her

you go ahead and start off the prayer the  operator said

please help and get me out of this water dear father stevens said

again she apologized for sounding rude but she was afraid

this will teach you next time dont drive in the water the dispatcher told her

stevens insisted she didnt see the flood waters shes worked her paper route  years and never experienced anything like this

i dont know how you didnt see it you had to go right over it the water just didnt appear

about  minutes into the call the dispatcher took other calls police said many stranded residents were calling that morning

stevens continued to weep the dispatcher tried to describe to firefighters the stranded womans location

im on the phone with her she said shes freaking out

about  minutes into the call the dispatcher asked a firefighter whether he could see stevens suv negative he said there was confusion about her location

stevens cried uncontrollably

miss debbie youre going to have to shut up the dispatcher said can you honk your horn

my horn is dead stevens said everything is dead

the water was climbing above the door of her suv she said oh lord help me she cried the dispatcher said rescuers were looking for her

oh my god my car is starting to move stevens cried

ok listen to me i know the dispatcher said im trying to get you help i know youre scared just hold on for me because ive got to take other calls

stevens starting screaming she said couldnt breathe

im on the phone with her right now the dispatcher said to a rescuer she is legit freaking out

im going to die stevens said

miss debbie youre breathing just fine because you are screaming at me so calm down i know youre scared hold on for me

stevens is not heard again

miss debbie miss debbie the dispatcher said oh my god she sounds like shes under water now

the call ended at  am et

rescuers reached stevens suv some  minutes later they tried unsuccessfully to revive her

fort smith police said in a statement that it released the audio recording of the call with great reluctance after requests from the media

the recording contains the audio of a dying persons last moments as well as the interaction between her and the  operator the statement said

and while the operators response to this extremely tense and dynamic event sounds calloused and uncaring at times sincere efforts were being made to locate and save mrs stevens

stevens first call during the emergency was to her mother in law police said she then dialed  from her cell phone

fort smith fire and police units were inundated with  calls from people stranded in flood waters the statement said stevens difficulty describing her location and flooding limited the ability of first responders to reach her the statement said

i am heartbroken for this tragic loss of life and my prayers are with debras family and friends police chief danny baker said in a statement

all of our first responders who attempted to save mrs stevens are distraught over the outcome for every one of us saving lives is at the very core of who we are and why we do what we do when we are unsuccessful it hurts

the stevens family did not respond to multiple requests by cnn for comment

police spokesman aric mitchell said the  operator had submitted her two weeks notice on august  she happened to be working her last shift the morning of the tragedy

the incident will certainly lead to us looking at policies within our existing communications unit but we have not completed a review at this time to make specific determinations mitchell said
